Lay back I told you tonight I’m using you I climb on top, naked and wet 🍑, your hands stay where I said I keep you inside, deep, until you're shaking When you beg, I just whisper, “Not yet” 🖤
^
I said don’t move You were already hard 🍆 when I sat down on you Slowly Eyes locked You tried to thrust once and I grabbed your throat “Mine,” I said You nodded Didn’t even blink 💦
^
I was on the couch, legs open, no panties You walked in and froze 😈 My fingers were already between my thighs “Get over here,” I said And the second you did, I pulled you in, wet and ready 🔥
^
You said you were tired I didn’t care I sucked your cock until you moaned 🍆, then climbed on you, riding slow while watching you try to hold back “Cum inside me,” I whispered You lost it 💧
^
I bent over the table, on purpose No panties, short skirt, and I pretended to look for something while you stared 🍑 You came behind me, pressed up, hard “Just do it already,” I moaned 🔥
^
You were gaming I dropped to my knees next to you and looked up 🖤 “Pause it” You didn’t I pulled your cock out and wrapped my lips around it 🍆 I wanted to ruin your focus And I did 💦
^
I tied your hands You didn’t expect that I kissed your thighs first, then your cock, teasing 👅 When you begged for more, I smiled and sat on your face instead “Earn it,” I said 😈
^
I sat on your lap with no warning, grinding slow You were on the phone 📞 I whispered in your ear, “Talk normal” You struggled to keep your voice steady while I kept bouncing 🍑💦
^
We were at dinner I slipped my hand under the table, found your cock, hard already 😏 I stroked you slow while keeping eye contact, licking my lips “You better fuck me the second we get home” 🔥
^
I made you lay back, no talking Just me, taking control My tongue on your tip 🍆, slow circles You moaned, I smiled “You’re not cumming until I say so,” I said, then sucked deeper 💧🖤
^
I was in the kitchen, just in your shirt, sipping coffee You came up behind me, kissed my neck, and wrapped your arms around my waist “You taste like trouble,” you whispered I turned, pushed you against the counter, and dropped to my knees 🍆 I didn’t stop until I felt your whole body tense under my hands Then I stood up, grabbed your jaw, kissed you slow and messy, and said, “Now go sit I’m not done with you yet” 🔥
^
We stayed in that morning No alarms, no clothes I woke up wrapped around you, your hand on my thigh, your breath against my shoulder 🖤 I didn’t say a word Just reached between us, felt how ready you already were 🍆 I kissed your neck, climbed on top, slid down slow, and held your face while you moaned my name I rode you lazy, deep, looking in your eyes When you started shaking, I kissed you again “Stay with me,” I whispered “I want to feel you cum inside me” 💧
^
You had a long day I could see it in your eyes So I ran you a hot bath, sat behind you in the tub, kissed your shoulder, and massaged you in silence But I didn’t stop at your shoulders 😈 I reached between your legs, slow, teasing, and whispered, “Let me take your stress out through your cock” You laid back, let me stroke and suck you until your hands gripped the sides of the tub 🍆💦 And even after you came, I didn’t stop I just smiled, kissed you, and whispered, “That was round one”
^
We were dancing in the living room, slow, bodies close My fingers tracing your back, lips brushing your neck 🍑 The song ended, but I didn’t stop moving I pressed my hips into yours and looked up at you “Want to dance in the bedroom too?” I whispered And before you could answer, I was on the bed, legs open, fingers already playing with myself “Come show me how much you missed me,” I said, licking my lips You didn’t even take your shirt off 🔥
^
You were asleep when I crawled on top of you Soft sheets, moonlight coming in through the window 🖤 I kissed your chest, your stomach, lower and lower until I felt you twitch against my lips 🍆 You woke up moaning, eyes still hazy I looked up at you and said, “Just let me love you like this” I kept going, slow, messy, deep, until you couldn’t hold back You filled my mouth and I swallowed everything, never breaking eye contact 💧 Then I laid on your chest, smiling, tracing your skin “Good morning”
